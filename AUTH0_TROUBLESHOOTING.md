# Auth0 Troubleshooting Guide

## The Error You're Seeing
"Oops!, something went wrong" typically means one of these Auth0 configuration issues:

## Quick Fixes to Try:

### 1. **Update Auth0 Application Settings**
In your Auth0 Dashboard → Applications → RentRoll AI Frontend:

**Application Type:** Native Application ✅ (You already set this)

**Allowed Callback URLs:** 
```
http://localhost:3000/callback
```

**Allowed Logout URLs:**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

**Allowed Web Origins:**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

**Allowed Origins (CORS):**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. **Check API Configuration**
In Auth0 Dashboard → APIs → RentRoll AI API:
- **Identifier:** `https://api.rentroll-ai.com` ✅
- **Signing Algorithm:** RS256 ✅

### 3. **Verify Domain**
Make sure your Auth0 domain is exactly: `rentroll-ai.us.auth0.com`

### 4. **Enable Debug Mode**
Add this to your Auth0 application for better error messages:
- In Settings → Advanced Settings → Grant Types
- Make sure "Authorization Code" is checked

### 5. **Test Steps**
1. Save all Auth0 settings
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for propagation
3. Clear browser cache/cookies
4. Try logging in again at: http://localhost:3000

### 6. **Alternative: Skip Auth0 Temporarily**
If you want to test the platform immediately, I can enable development mode bypass.

## Status Check
✅ Backend running with Auth0 config loaded
✅ Frontend running on localhost:3000
⚠️ Auth0 application settings need verification

Let me know if you want me to:
1. Help debug the Auth0 settings further
2. Enable temporary bypass mode for testing
3. Create a test user manually
