# Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform Implementation Plan

## Architecture Overview

### Authentication Flow
```
User Login (Auth0) → JWT Token → Client Context → Dataset Routing → Analytics
```

### Database Structure
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Multi-Tenancy (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Auth0 integration (React + FastAPI)
- [ ] Client management system
- [ ] Dynamic dataset creation
- [ ] User-to-client mapping
- [ ] Client context middleware

### Phase 2: Data Isolation (Week 3-4)  
- [ ] Client-aware upload system
- [ ] Per-client analytics tables
- [ ] Client-specific ETL pipelines
- [ ] Data access controls

### Phase 3: Admin & Billing (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Super admin dashboard
- [ ] Cross-client analytics
- [ ] Unit count tracking
- [ ] Usage reporting
- [ ] Client onboarding flow

### Phase 4: Production Ready (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Monitoring & alerts
- [ ] Backup strategies
- [ ] Documentation

## Technical Stack

### Authentication
- **Auth0** for user management
- **JWT tokens** for API authentication
- **Role-based access control**
  - `super_admin`: You (access all clients)
  - `client_admin`: Client administrator
  - `client_user`: Regular client user

### Backend Changes
- **Client context injection** in all endpoints
- **Dynamic table routing** based on client
- **Multi-tenant upload service**
- **Cross-client analytics** for super admin

### Frontend Changes
- **Auth0 React SDK** integration
- **Client context management**
- **Super admin interface**
- **Client onboarding wizard**

## Business Logic

### Client Onboarding
1. Super admin creates client account
2. System creates BigQuery dataset (`client_[uuid]`)
3. Client receives login credentials
4. Client uploads initial data
5. Analytics become available
6. Unit counting begins for billing

### Monthly Operations
1. Client uploads monthly data
2. ETL pipeline updates analytics tables
3. Unit counts tracked for billing
4. Analytics refresh automatically

### Super Admin Capabilities
- View all client data
- Cross-client analytics
- Usage and billing reports
- Client management
- System monitoring

## Data Security

### Client Isolation
- Each client has dedicated BigQuery dataset
- Row-level security based on client_id
- API endpoints validate client access
- No cross-client data visibility

### Access Control
- Auth0 handles authentication
- JWT tokens carry client context
- Backend validates all data access
- Audit logging for compliance

## Billing Model

### Unit Tracking
- Count units per client per month
- Track in `system.billing_units` table
- Generate monthly usage reports
- Automated billing integration ready

### Pricing Tiers (Future)
- Basic: $X per unit per month
- Pro: $Y per unit per month + advanced features
- Enterprise: Custom pricing + dedicated support

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Auth0 setup** - Get authentication working
2. **Build client management** - Core multi-tenancy
3. **Update upload system** - Client-aware data handling
4. **Add super admin features** - Cross-client analytics
5. **Production deployment** - Security & monitoring

## Success Metrics

- **Client Onboarding**: < 1 hour from signup to first analytics
- **Data Isolation**: 100% - no cross-client data leaks
- **Performance**: < 2 second page loads regardless of client size
- **Billing Accuracy**: 100% accurate unit counting
- **Super Admin**: Real-time visibility into all clients
